Description:
    Our app will use AWS to host pictures of dogs and their owners who don't clean up after their dogs. 
    Our plan is to allow users to upload pictures of offenders, and possibly their "evidence". Users will also be able to pinpoint the scene of the crime through integration with google maps API.
    Incidences of inappropriate doggy damage will display on our landing page.
